https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] is service to start remote, container-based, development environments on Red Hat OpenShift.

As an open-source project, the core goals of https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  are to:

* **Accelerate project and developer onboarding:** As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* **Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:** As https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  provides:

* **Workspaces:** Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* **Browser-based IDEs:** Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tooling, debuggers, terminal, source control (SCM) integration, and much more. Bundled IDEs are Eclipse Theia, Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ.
* **Extensible platform:** Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using custom container images and installing IDE extensions.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Multi-user capabilities (including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD) and restricted network support (including enteprise SSL certificate bundles and internal proxies).

[#get_your_developer_workspace]
== Accessing your Developer Workspace with a single click

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] provides a *Developer Workspace* out of the box, with all the tools and the dependencies we need to complete the lab. **And with only one single click!**

[NOTE]
.Devfile
====
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] uses https://devfile.io/docs/2.1.0/what-is-a-devfile[Devfiles^] to automate the provisioning of a specific workspace by defining:

* application runtime definition
* preconfigured commands

Providing a devfile.yaml file inside a Git source repository signals to https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] to configure the project and runtime according
to this file.
====

Go to your Red Hat Developer Sandbox and click on the 'Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces' button:

This will provision *OpenShift Dev Spaces* in a new tab. 

Once completed, you will have a fully functional browser-based IDE.
